The existence of gravitational waves has been speculation for nearly 100 years, and the scientists at LIGO have finally detected gravitational waves. In 1974 astronomers started to closely observed a binary pulsar and found that they were moving closer at a rate precisely predicted by general relativity. As the stars approached each other, the data supporting the existence of gravitational waves constantly grew. Finally in the end of 2015 LIGO has detected space-time disturbances that confirm the existence of gravitational waves. While not directly ground breaking, the existence of gravitational waves gives scientists further paths in understanding general relativity and the universe as a whole.
