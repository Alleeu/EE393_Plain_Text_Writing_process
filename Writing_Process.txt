General Info:
Gravitational waves are 'ripples' in the fabic of space-time.
First predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 in this theory of relativity.
Can be caused by the interation between massive accelerating objects orbiting each other. Neutron stars or black holes.
The waves travel at the speed of light throughout the universe.
The waves carry information about their origins and can help scientists understand gravity better.
Strongest waves are produced by catastrophic events like, colliding black holes, supernovae and the coladescing of neutron stars or white dwarf stars.

Discovery:
No proof of existance until 1974, two astronomers at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico discovered a binary pulsar. 
According to general relativity the two extremely dense stars in the binary pulsar should produce gravitational waves.
After 8 years of observations, astronomers foudn that the two starts were approaching each other at "precisely the rate prdicted by general relativity." 
Over time many astronomers have studied other pulsars and found similar results.
In september 2015, the Laser Interfermoter Graviational-Wave observitory (LIGO) detected distortions that are believed to have ben generated by two colliding black holes near 1.3 billion light years away.

Why study them?
normally scientists would study electromagnetic radiation and neutrinos were studied. but EM radiation is subject to interference and not everything will emit EM radation
Gravitational waves can be used to detect events like colliding black wholes, which normally emits little or no electromagnetic radiation.
Gravitational waves also inveract very weakly with matter and this can travel through the universe nearly unimpeded.
